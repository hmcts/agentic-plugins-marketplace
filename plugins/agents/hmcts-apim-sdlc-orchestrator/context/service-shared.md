## What Service Repos Are

`service-cp-*` repos are **runnable Spring Boot 4.0.x microservices**. Each implements one or more generated interfaces from an `api-cp-*` JAR dependency. All services run on port `4550` by default.

Two patterns exist:
- **Stateless proxy**: Controller → Service → HTTP Client to CP backend. No DB. WireMock for API tests.
- **DB-backed**: Adds PostgreSQL + Flyway + JPA entities + Azure Service Bus. Only `service-cp-crime-hearing-results-document-subscription` currently follows this pattern.

## Commands

```bash
# Build
./gradlew build                         # full build + unit/integration tests
./gradlew build -x test                 # skip all tests
./gradlew build -x apiTest              # skip API tests only (API tests need Docker; use this for faster local builds)

# Test
./gradlew test                          # unit + integration tests
./gradlew test --tests '<ClassName>'                    # single class
./gradlew test --tests '<ClassName.methodName>'         # single method
./gradlew check                         # tests + JaCoCo coverage

# Run locally (requires any needed infrastructure — DB, Service Bus — already running)
./gradlew bootRun

# Code quality
./gradlew pmdMain                       # PMD static analysis
./gradlew spotlessCheck                 # format check
./gradlew spotlessApply                 # auto-fix formatting
./gradlew jacocoTestReport              # coverage report → build/reports/jacoco/

# Code generation (only if this service depends on a local api-cp-* change)
./gradlew openApiGenerate               # regenerate from OpenAPI spec — never edit build/generated/ manually
```

### API tests

API tests run against a live Docker stack. The mechanism differs by service pattern:

- **Stateless proxy services** — `./gradlew dockerTest` (docker-compose: WireMock + app)
- **DB-backed services** — separate `apiTest/` Gradle project; run via `cd apiTest && ./build-and-run-apitest.sh` (docker-compose: PostgreSQL + Service Bus emulator + app)

Each service's `CLAUDE.md` documents which applies and the exact docker-compose commands needed to start the required infrastructure.

## Architecture Rules

### Layer Model

Each layer has one responsibility and communicates only with the layer directly below it.

| Layer | Responsibility | Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| **Controller** | Receive HTTP; validate thoroughly; delegate to Manager or Service | No business logic; no object construction |
| **Manager** | Orchestrate multiple services; prevent bi-directional service dependencies | No direct repository calls |
| **Service** | Business logic; call clients and repositories via mappers | Never construct objects inline — delegate all construction to a mapper |
| **Mapper** | Convert objects between layers AND create any new objects | Owns all `.builder()` calls; has its own focused unit test covering field-by-field construction |
| **Repository** | JPA entity interactions | Must have a `@DataJpaTest` test proving Flyway schema matches JPA entity |
| **Client** | External HTTP calls | No business logic |

**Mapper-creates-objects rule:** Mappers do not only convert — they also create new objects. A service method must never call `.builder()` directly. This means:
- Service unit tests mock the mapper and verify the call — no `ArgumentCaptor` needed
- All construction logic is tested once in a focused mapper test

**Other layering rules:**
- **Controllers are thin**: delegate entirely to services or managers; return `ResponseEntity` only.
- **MapStruct mappers** in `src/main/java/.../mappers/` — never edit generated `*Impl` classes.
- **Error handling**: `EntityNotFoundException` for 404s; `ResponseStatusException` for business errors; `GlobalExceptionHandler` (`@RestControllerAdvice`) maps everything else.
- **Input validation**: validate at the earliest boundary — controller (`@Valid`) for HTTP flows, `ServiceBusHandlers` for Service Bus flows. Domain services must not throw `IllegalArgumentException` for input that should have been rejected upstream. Use `org.owasp.encoder.Encode.forJava()` before passing URN or case ID inputs to backend calls.
- **HTTP clients**: build URLs with `UriComponentsBuilder`; set `CJSCPPUID` header on every backend call.

### Feature Toggle Placement

Feature toggles (`@Value`-injected booleans) are decision-layer concerns. Five rules apply — all exist to ensure that when a toggle is removed, a grep for the property key finds every place to clean up with no hidden data-state remnants.

**T1 — `@Value` toggle fields live only in orchestrating services.**
Persist/domain services and controllers must not declare `@Value` toggle fields.

**T2 — Toggle check is explicit and at call-site.**
Reference the boolean field directly before calling downstream — never delegate to a private method that returns a sentinel value.

**T3 — Switch state must not be inferred from data state.**
Do not return `null` (or any sentinel) to encode toggle-off, then null-check downstream to infer state. When the toggle is removed, null checks in data flow do not appear in a grep and survive as dead code.
```java
// WRONG — null check survives toggle removal invisibly
final UUID id = featureEnabled ? svc.save(p) : null;
if (id != null) { downstreamSvc.save(id); }

// CORRECT — both branches are findable on removal
if (featureEnabled) {
    final UUID id = svc.save(p);
    downstreamSvc.save(id);
}
```

**T4 — Persist/domain services are toggle-blind.**
Any class that owns a `Repository` must not declare any `@Value` toggle field. It does exactly what its method name says, unconditionally.

**T5 — No dead toggle fields.**
If a `@Value` toggle field is declared but never read in that class, remove it.

### Coding Patterns

- **Explicit idempotency**: when a persist method skips a duplicate (`existsBy…` → return), it must log at INFO at the skip site. Silent returns with no trace are not permitted.
- **Test naming**: all test methods follow `subject_should_doOutcome` or `subject_should_doOutcome_whenCondition`. Mixed styles within one class are not permitted.
- **No `inOrder` in unit tests**: use plain `verify` — the transaction rollback is the real safeguard and `inOrder` in one test without applying it consistently across the suite is misleading. Do not introduce it.
- **Delete scenarios belong in integration tests, not API/e2e tests**: when a delete operation needs a test, fix or extend the existing `@SpringBootTest` integration test (insert the record first, then delete) rather than adding a new API/e2e test. API tests cover happy-path flows only; adding delete-specific e2e tests inflates the suite without proportionate value.
- **Time access goes through `ClockService`, never a raw `Clock` bean**: any class needing "now" (timestamps, date comparisons, expiry checks) depends on a `ClockService` wrapper, not `java.time.Clock` directly.
  - `AppConfig` exposes exactly one bean: `ClockService clockService() { return new ClockService(Clock.systemDefaultZone()); }` — do not also expose a `Clock` bean alongside it.
  - `ClockService` itself (in `services/`) wraps a `Clock` and exposes typed accessors — `now()` returning `Instant`, `nowOffsetUTC()` returning `OffsetDateTime`; add further accessors (e.g. a `LocalDate` getter) only when a real call site needs one, following the same wrap-don't-leak pattern.
  - Tests construct `new ClockService(Clock.fixed(...))` for deterministic time — never let a test depend on the real system clock for date/time assertions.
  - Rationale: a raw injected `Clock` lets every call site repeat its own `Instant`/`LocalDate`/`OffsetDateTime` conversion logic; centralising it in one service keeps that conversion consistent and swappable in one place.

## Configuration Standards

- `application.yaml` uses `${VAR:default}` — all new env vars **must** be documented in `.envrc.example`
- Actuator base path: `/actuator`; endpoints exposed: `health`, `info`, `prometheus`
- Port: `4550` (override via `SERVER_PORT` env var)
- Backend URLs injected via `AppPropertiesBackend` — never hardcode in clients

## TracingFilter Standard

All services implement `TracingFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter`:
- Reads `X-Correlation-Id` from inbound request; generates a UUID if absent
- Sets `X-Correlation-Id` on MDC and on the response
- Skips actuator and root (`/`) paths
- Cleans up MDC in `finally` block (prevents MDC leaks between requests)

## Observability

- `@Slf4j` — INFO for business events, DEBUG for tracing details
- Micrometer → Prometheus metrics at `/actuator/prometheus`
- Azure Application Insights via `rpe.AppInsightsInstrumentationKey` env var
- `management.tracing.sampling.probability: 1.0` (100% sampling)

## Flyway Migrations (DB-backed services only)

- Location: `src/main/resources/db/migration/`
- Naming: `V<VERSION>__<description>.sql`
- Auto-runs on `bootRun` and test startup
- All JPA entities use UUID PKs: `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.UUID)`
- PostgreSQL 12+ (Testcontainers handles test DB automatically)

## Docker

- Base image: `eclipse-temurin:25-jre`
- Non-root user `app` — all Dockerfiles create and run as this user
- Entry point: `/app/startup.sh`
- AppInsights agent mounted from `lib/applicationinsights.json`
- WireMock (`wiremock/wiremock:3.6.0`) for API tests
- Testcontainers for DB integration tests (no manual Docker required)

## CI/CD Workflows

### Workflow files

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ci-draft.yml` | PR + push to main | Calls `ci-build-publish.yml`; on PR: build + tests + API tests; on push: also publish JAR + Docker + deploy to dev |
| `ci-released.yml` | GitHub Release published | Same reusable workflow; `is_release: true`; deploys to SIT (not dev) |
| `ci-build-publish.yml` | Called by draft/released | Reusable: version → build (with `composeUp`/`composeDown`) → publish JAR → push to GHCR → ACR copy (ADO 460) → deploy (ADO 434) |
| `code-analysis.yml` | PR | PMD via `pmd/pmd-github-action@v2` against `.github/pmd-ruleset.xml`; fails on any violation |
| `codeql.yml` | PR + weekly (Thu) | GitHub CodeQL (`security-extended`, Java) + OWASP ZAP DAST scan + CycloneDX SBOM |
| `secrets-scanner.yml` | PR + push + weekly (Thu) | `hmcts/secrets-scanner@main` (gitleaks + custom regex) |
| `auto-merge-dependabot.yml` | Any PR | Auto-approves and merges Dependabot PRs on minor/patch bumps |

### Build mechanics in CI

The build job wraps all tests with docker-compose:
```
./gradlew composeUp
./gradlew build -DARTEFACT_VERSION=<version>   # runs unit + integration tests against live compose stack
./gradlew composeDown
```
API tests (`apiTest/build-and-run-apitest.sh`) run as a separate job after the build passes.

### Deployment pipeline (push to main / release)

```
GitHub Actions (GHA)
  ├─ Build + test (Gradle + docker-compose)
  ├─ Publish JAR → GitHub Packages + Azure Artifacts
  ├─ Build + push Docker image → GHCR (ghcr.io/<repo>:<version>)
  └─ Trigger ADO pipeline 460 (hmcts/trigger-ado-pipeline@v2)
       └─ Copies GHCR image → ACR (crmdvrepo01.azurecr.io)
            └─ ADO pipeline 434 (hmcts/action-ado-deploy@v1)
                 └─ Commits image tag to hmcts/cp-vp-aks-deploy
                      ├─ push to main  → env/dev branch  → K8-DEV-CS01-CL02
                      └─ release       → env/sit branch  → K8-SIT-CS01-CL02
```

Deployment target repo: `hmcts/cp-vp-aks-deploy`, values file: `vp-config/services_values.yml`.
Dev deployment is automatic on every push to main. SIT deployment triggers only on GitHub Release publish.

### Required secrets

`AZURE_DEVOPS_ARTIFACT_USERNAME`, `AZURE_DEVOPS_ARTIFACT_TOKEN`, `HMCTS_ADO_PAT`,
`DEPLOYMENT_APP_ID`, `DEPLOYMENT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GITLEAKS_LICENSE`, `HMCTS_CP_GITLEAKS_REGEX_INTERNAL_URL`

## Key Constraints

- **Java 25**, **Spring Boot 4.0.6+** (target; current repos range 4.0.1–4.0.6 — upgrade per cycle)
- **Jakarta EE** (not `javax`)
- `-Werror` — compiler warnings fail the build
- **RestTemplate** for all HTTP clients (RestClient migration is planned but not yet started)
- No direct DB access from controllers; no business logic in MapStruct mappers
- New env vars → document in `.envrc.example` before raising a PR
- `CJSCPPUID` is the standard client identity header for all CP backend calls
